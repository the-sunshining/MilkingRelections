            <p>
Hi, it's me N.C.R. here again.<br/>
It has been about three years since I originally wrote "milking devotional". I don't know why I chose to title it that and I didn't like the front cover.
</p><p>
I have been thinking about updating the book for a while. It is now 2020, a lot has happened since 2017. This is now going on the fourth year since our family got our first milk cow. And it's kind of funny. I am standing outside the milking barn writing this book. Though I have done some milking over the last three years, it is mainly my brother Sam's responsibility. Milking is not really a 2 person job, but … We started in 2017 with a wild cow. She became quite tame and so in 2018 and 2019 I didn't help too much with the milking at all. I have been so busy the last three summers, They are just kind of a blur in my mind. 
</p><p>
But this year, 2020, our good old milk cow didn't have a calf. So this year 2020 we are starting with a new wild cow. And also this summer I am not so busy. But I am using all my spare time to write, so I guess you could say I am quite busy.
</p><p>
I am looking forward to this summer, and what I will write this summer. They say you are supposed to write the introduction last. But I have never done that. So as I am writing this and as you are reading this the updated new content that I am writing this summer is unknown to both of us. The original content I wrote in 2017 can be found in part one of this book. The new content that I am writing can be found in part two. And because I told you I write the introduction first I won't bother to change anything in this introduction to past tense once I write part two of this book.
</p><p>
Well, I hope you enjoy this book, even though it was written in 2017-2020. I hope that no matter when you are reading this book you will enjoy it.

            <p>
                Some people believe in predestination. <br/>
                I do not.<br/>
                 I believe that people can determine their own destination.<br/>
                Where will you end up?<br/>
                 Heaven or Hell?
                </p><p>
                    Just a few weeks ago when I was learning to milk my aunt said to my brother Sam,
                     “You were born to milk.”<br/>
                      I jokingly said, “I must not have been born to milk.”
                    </p><p>
                 I do not believe that I was predestined to not milk, but if I did believe that I would probably never have been able to milk. Likewise if you believe you are predestined to hell that is most likely where you will end up. 
                </p><p>
                Since I am able to milk you should be able to make it to heaven. You are not predestined to hell. I know you do not want to end up there, so don’t.

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">It is harder than it looks</h3>
            <p>
                When I was a little kid I loved to pretend I was milking a cow.
                 I squeezed pencils like they were teats.
                  It was so easy to imagine I was milking a cow.
            </p><p>
                But did you know that milking a cow is harder than you can imagine,
                 it is even harder than it looks. 
               Many people think being a Christian is easy.
                They think that as soon as you become a Christian life will be easy.
                 But being a Christian is harder than you can imagine.
                  Many people have given up being Christians,
                   because it was harder than they thought it was.
            </p><p>
                Milking a cow was harder than I thought.
                 If I would have given up milking a cow I would never have learned how,
                  nor would I have ever become good at it.
                   Likewise if you give up being a Christian you will never make it to heaven. 
            </p><p>
               <b>Tip</b>: Do not give up. 
               (Whether you are learning to milk or whatever, do not give up.)

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">Milk is born clean</h3>
            <p>
                Milk is clean as long as it is in the udder. But no matter how hard you try to keep it clean it gets dirty just about as soon as it leaves the udder. Sometimes the milk gets too dirty we have throw it out. All the milk we do keep though no matter how clean it looks needs to be strained. And some milk even once it is strained still has specks in it. 
            </p><p>
                Men we are just about like milk, except we are dirty before we even leave the womb. Also milk can not choose to be cleaned or stay dirty, we can choose.
              <br/>
                Do you want to be cleaned?<br/>
                Christ died for you so that you may be washed as white as snow with his blood.
            </p><p>
               You also unlike milk can choose to get dirty again if you want. <br/>
               And if you get too dirty you will get thrown out because God cannot use you.<br/>
               Try to keep your life pure so that God may use you.
               </p>

            <p>
                Like I said in the last chapter milk is born clean, but it gets dirty.<br/>
                Does anyone know how it gets dirty?<br/>
            </p><p>
                It gets dirty because of its surroundings. The cleaner the surroundings the cleaner the milk. The dirtier the surroundings the dirtier the milk.
            </p><p>
                Milk does not have the ability to choose its surroundings. But we do. Choose your friends wisely. 
            </p><p>
                The cleaner your friends the cleaner you will be.
            </p><p>
                <b>Tip</b>: Make sure your surroundings are clean. (Whether your milking surroundings or your life surroundings.)

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">What is faith?</h3>
            <p>
                Squeeze. Squeeze. Um there is no milk coming out. This has happened to me a few times, and when it happens I can choose to believe it will not come. Or I can have faith that it will come. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's say I choose to have faith it will come out. What does that mean? What is faith?
            </p><p>
                To me the word faith and believe is the same thing. But faith is a little a little more than just believing. Faith is doing because you believe. You may believe something will happen, but unless you act on what you believe you have no faith. Believing without doing is not faith; doing without believing is not faith. Both believing and doing is faith.
            </p>
            <p>
               I may believe that milk will come out, but what good will believing do if I do not squeeze!
            </p>
            <p>

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">Cows only kick when they are hurt</h3>
            <p>
                People say that cows only kick when they are hurt. Whether this is true or not I do not know. But I do know that it is OK for a cow to kick when it is hurt (It is also OK for people for people to swear when they are hurt). But it can get pretty annoying if cows kick even when they are not hurt (It is annoying if people swear too much, or all the time.) 
            </p><p>
                We have two cows at our place. One is named Sweety. While it may have a sweet name it is not sweet. It is bad. Why? Because it kicks to much (People are also bad if they swear to much). 
            </p><p>
                By now you are probably thinking “I like this writer, because he says it is ok for me to swear sometimes”, or you may be like “I never want to read anything by this lousy author ever again”. All the the things in parentheses above would only be true for us if we were animals like cows. But we are not. We are humans. And as humans we should never swear. If your cow kicked while you were milking it, you would say that it is bad even though it may have been hurt.  We have brains unlike animals and we know it is bad to swear even if we are hurt.
            </p><p>
               "But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:
                Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
               Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black." - <b>Matthew 5:34-37</b>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">Milking is Hard</h3>
            <p>
                Milking can be compared to hardships.<br/>
                 Because like milking, hardships are hard, and like milking, hardships can strengthen you.<br/>
                Who likes to be strong?<br/>
                Who likes hardships?
            </p><p>
                While most people may like to be strong, nobody likes hardships.
                But as the old saying goes, “Nothing good in life is ever easy.”
                Being spiritually strong is good, but it is hard.
                I have sometimes milked our cow until I was so wore out. Hardships can wear you out, and if you do not give up they will also make you strong.

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">God loves You</h3>
            <p>
                Some people think that because they are Christians and because God loves them, that God will automatically bless them. But that is about the same as saying a cow will milk itself just because it loves you and just because you are a milker. God, no matter how much he loves you, cannot automatically bless you for being a Christian. Nor can your cow milk itself, no matter how much it loves you.
            </p><p>
                If you want to be blessed you have to be more than a Christian, you have to be christlike.<br/>
                If you want milk you will have to be more than a milker, you will have to milk.<br/>
                (Note: Everyone knows a Christian is to be Christlike, and that a milker milks.)

            <p>
                Right now I am not milking a cow. Actually I have wrote none of the things in this book while I am milking a cow. Now even though I am not milking a cow I can still learn a lot from cow milking.<br/>
                I just learned that it is good to memorize Bible verses.<br/>
                You may be wondering “how in the world did I learn that.”
            </p><p>
                Well like I said you can learn a lot from milking even when you are not milking. That is a lot like the Bible. You can learn a lot from the Bible when you read it. And you can learn a lot from the Bible even when you do not have it only if you memorize what the Bible says. Therefore I learned it is good to memorize Bible verses.

            <p>
                I am surprised that many people still think chocolate milk comes from brown cows.
            </p><p>
                “Regardless of skin color, wealth, or nationality all cows produce the same white milk, though different cows may produce milk that tastes a little bit different, and with different amounts of cream.”
            </p><p>
               Now even though a lot of people think chocolate milk comes from brown cows, it is probably not likely that you think chocolate milk comes from brown cows. But did you know that there is something which can be compared to thinking brown cows produce chocolate milk, and it is very likely that you could be guilty of it.
            </p><p>
               It is a big sin, and it is called prejudice. Basically prejudice is judging people too early, before you know them, and for the wrong reasons, like their skin color, wealth, health, or nationality.
            </p><p>
              <b>Tip</b>: You can never be too slow to judge, so make sure you do not judge too quickly.

            <h3 class="reflectionTitle">Milking takes time</h3>
            <p>
                Milking takes time, but you know what it is not the only thing that takes time. In Matthew 28:18-20 Jesus commands us to go into all the world.
            </p><p>
                "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, 
                All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
             Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
              and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
               I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen." 
               - <b>Matthew 28:18-20 KJV</b>
            </p><p>
               That is something that takes a lot of time. Unless you put any time into that you will never succeed in doing what Jesus commanded. Unless you put any time into milking you will never get milk.
            </p><p>
               How much time do you spend milking each day?<br/>
               How much time do you spend sharing the good news?<br/>
               How does that amount of time compare?<br/>
               You should spend time each day sharing the good news.<br/>
               And if you have a cow you should spend more time sharing the good news than milking it.
